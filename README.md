# IPL-Team-Managment

# Problem Details <br/>
● The frontend application needs to be implemented using HTML, CSS
and JavaScript. For data handling use local storage.<br/>
● You have to design the UI for all the webpages as well. There will be
marks for clear and beautiful UI design.<br/>
● On the homepage show a card based grid of all the teams. On the
team card click take the user to the team details page.<br/>
● Team Details Page will have following information:<br/>
○ Team Name<br/>
○ Team Icon<br/>
○ Player Count<br/>
○ Top Batsman<br/>
○ Top Bowler<br/>
○ Championship Won Count<br/>
○ Card grid with all the players. Player card should have following
information:<br/>
■ Full Name<br/>
■ Photo<br/>
■ Team<br/>
■ Price<br/>
■ Playing Status - Playing or On-bench<br/>
■ Role - Batsman, Bowler or All-rounder.<br/>
○ Player card click should take to the player details page. Player
details page will have the same details as the card but with a
different design.<br/>
● From the homepage, users can also search players from different
teams by entering a team name. For example - MI(Mumbai Indians),
RR(Rajasthan Royals) etc. You should return all players present in the
local storage from the same team searched by the user.
